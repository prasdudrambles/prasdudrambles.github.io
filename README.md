A blog of random musings, under-researched ideas and exploration of questions that no one dare ask, for the fear of being called an idiot. It's fine, we're all idiots here.

One of my hobbies is building stuff from scratch. You can find everything i write on my github.

You're an employer? You want my Resume? heres something <a href="https://www.github.com/prasdud">better!</a>
