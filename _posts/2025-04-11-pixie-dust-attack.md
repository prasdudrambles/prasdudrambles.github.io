<h1>WHAT IS WPS</h1>
WPS stands for Wi-Fi Protected Setup. It is a network standard created by Cisco in 2006. The main goal of WPS was to make life easier for normal users to setup their own home networks.

Setting up a Wi-Fi Protected Network can sometimes be daunting for less technically knowledgeable users, people who don't really care about how things work as long as it works, WPS was created for such users.

WPS eliminates the need for typing out complex passwords to connect to the network. On devices like televisions which have a lack of input device, it makes it easier for it to connect to the network.

The 2 most popular methods in WPS are either a WPS push button, where the user pushes a physical button on the back of the router to connect a device to it - theoretically, anyone could just gain access to the router and log onto the network.

The other method is more secure (but not really), where the user enters an 8 digit pin to connect the device.

This method is the target for Pixie Dust attacks.

<h1>DEFENSE AGAINT PIXIE DUST ATTACK</h1>
Just disable WPS in your router LOL.

But then again it comes back to people. Regular people don't care about all this because they lack awareness. This leads to majority of routers still having WPS enabled on their routers. So, in my opinion its upto the people who set up these networks to fully secure them.
